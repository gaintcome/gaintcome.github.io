### Abstract

The most common malware detection approaches
which are based on signature matching and are not sufficient
for metamorphic malware detection, since virus kits and
metamorphic engines can produce variants with no
resemblance to one another. Metamorphism provides an
efficient way for eluding malware detection software kits.
Code obfuscation methods like dead-code insertion are also
widely used in metamorphic malware. In order to address
the problem of detecting mutated generations, we propose a
method based on Opcode Graph Similarity (OGS). OGS
tries to detect metamorphic malware using the similarity of
opcode graphs. In this method, all nodes and edges have a
respective effect on classification, but in the proposed
method, edges of graphs are pruned using Linear
Discriminant Analysis (LDA). LDA is based on the concept
of searching for a linear combination of predictors that best
separates two or more classes. Most distinctive edges are
identified with LDA and the rest of edges are removed. The
metamorphic malware families considered here are NGVCK
and metamorphic worms that we denote these worms as
MWOR. The results show that our approach is capable of
classifying metamorphosed instances with no or minimum
false alarms. Also, our proposed method can detect NGVCK
and MWOR with high accuracy rate
