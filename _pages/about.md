Currently, I am pursuing a PhD in Cybersecurity at Northeastern University in Boston. I work as a member of [NEU SecLab](https://seclab.nu/) under the direction of Professors [Long Lu](https://www.longlu.org/) and [Engin Kirda](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/ek/). My research interests span a wide range of topics in systems security with a particular focus on software vulnerability detection, exploit mitigation techniques, and binary analysis. Currently, I am focusing on developing novel techniques to protect applications against memory safety vulnerabilities. I am especially interested in new security features in ARM architecture to accelerate the performance and security of the current systems.

In addition, I actively discover software vulnerabilities in open-source projects and report them to the developers. I have reported several flaws and vulnerabilities to open-source projects such as PHP, Tcpdump, OpenSSL, OpenSSH, and WebAssembly compiler. The MITRE has assigned CVE-2020-7060, CVE-2020-8036, CVE-2019-15758, and CVE-2019-15759 to my reports.
